  abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA microarrays are now capable of providing genome-wide
	patterns of gene expression across many different conditions. The
	first level of analysis of these patterns requires determining whether
	observed differences in expression are significant or not. Current
	methods are unsatisfactory due to the lack of a systematic framework
	that can accommodate noise, variability, and low replication often
	typical of microarray data. RESULTS: We develop a Bayesian probabilistic
	framework for microarray data analysis. At the simplest level, we
	model log-expression values by independent normal distributions,
	parameterized by corresponding means and variances with hierarchical
	prior distributions. We derive point estimates for both parameters
	and hyperparameters, and regularized expressions for the variance
	of each gene by combining the empirical variance with a local background
	variance associated with neighboring genes. An additional hyperparameter,
	inversely related to the number of empirical observations, determines
	the strength of the background variance. Simulations show that these
	point estimates, combined with a t -test, provide a systematic inference
	approach that compares favorably with simple t -test or fold methods,
	and partly compensate for the lack of replication.},

  abstract = {{Cost-effective oligonucleotide genotyping arrays like the Affymetrix
	SNP 6.0 are still the predominant technique to measure DNA copy number
	variations (CNVs). However, CNV detection methods for microarrays
	overestimate both the number and the size of CNV regions and, consequently,
	suffer from a high false discovery rate (FDR). A high FDR means that
	many CNVs are wrongly detected and therefore not associated with
	a disease in a clinical study, though correction for multiple testing
	takes them into account and thereby decreases the study's discovery
	power. For controlling the FDR, we propose a probabilistic latent
	variable model, ‘cn.FARMS’, which is optimized by a Bayesian maximum
	a posteriori approach. cn.FARMS controls the FDR through the information
	gain of the posterior over the prior. The prior represents the null
	hypothesis of copy number 2 for all samples from which the posterior
	can only deviate by strong and consistent signals in the data. On
	HapMap data, cn.FARMS clearly outperformed the two most prevalent
	methods with respect to sensitivity and FDR. The software cn.FARMS
	is publicly available as a R package at http://www.bioinf.jku.at/software/cnfarms/cnfarms.html.}},
