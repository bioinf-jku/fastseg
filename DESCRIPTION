Title: fastseg - a fast segmentation algorithm
Description: fastseg implements a very fast and efficient
    segmentation algorithm. It has similar functionality as
    DNACopy (Olshen and Venkatraman 2004), but is
    considerably faster and more flexible. fastseg can
    segment data from DNA microarrays and data
    from next generation sequencing for example to
    detect copy number segments. Further it can segment
    data from RNA microarrays like tiling arrays
    to identify transcripts. Most generally, it can segment
    data given as a matrix or as a vector. Various data
    formats can be used as input to fastseg like expression
    set objects for microarrays or GRanges for sequencing
    data. The segmentation criterion of fastseg is based on
    a statistical test in a Bayesian framework, namely the
    cyber t-test (Baldi 2001). The speed-up arises from the
    facts, that sampling is not necessary in for fastseg
    and that a dynamic programming approach is used for
    calculation of the segments' first and higher order
    moments.
